				<p>Roomba eats precious fine electricity, and human species body waste, although the latter aren't evolved yet to be dumped or used as energy by themselves as they are highly dependent on humans giving them a hand. As the humans are fully responsible for creating the species of robopods in the first place, we can discern that humans aren't very particularly capable in creating a species to a full extent.</p>

				<p>My favorite character is the reaper guy. he is very powerfull. special move, honestly is one of the best in the game and so he comes equipped with these two revolvers and only takes about 3 or 4 shots to actually execute a kill so it comes really in handy specially when you come from the side.</p>
				<br><br>
				<p>its kinda hard discussing this with you since you never really went out clubbing</p>
				<br><br>
				<p>Meanwhile humans carry on on their other daily tasks while their cared for creations batteries and motors slowly deteriorate to a point of which the robopod dies, humans species unable to recognize the waste of energy, dump the robot into a recycling bin to recover precious metals, while it’s shell will be remoulded into a fading car bumper that will end up in a landfill anyways. There goes a Roomba, in a bin, his life cycle didn’t live long past humans.</p>

				<p>You are a plague on the overwatch community. You are an entitled streamerboy who sits in his house and plays games, one tricking a hero for money. I go on twitter and all I see is "we have arrge, gg's". And you are bottlenecking yourself with higher ping. It's the same thing. You are a fucking troll. You are throwing; it's soft throwing; it's like me picking an off meta hero. Go play EEEEEEEUUUUUUU.</p>
